       "\"Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way. But, a group tour normally has its strict schedule and does not offer the tourists in group any chance to meet many people in new place. \\nSo, I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. \\n\\nFirst, a group tour has its own strict schedule and all the tour team members should follow it. And it means that I can not choose the place where I want go and the food which I want to eat. For example, when I went to Thailand for the first time, I chose a group tour because I was young and it was the first time to go abroad. I really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in Bangkok, but I couldn't go there because I was in a group tour and I had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered. And I had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening, even though I wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night. It was really bad experience. \\n\\nSecond, a group tour does not offer many opportunities to meet other people for its tour team members. Becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus, it is difficult to meet many people in new places. But if I travel alone, I can meet many people and feel their cultures. When I went to Tokyo by myself, I met really many people there. I could talk with them and some of them became my friends! Even though I could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour, choosing a place where I go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and Japanese people were kind to let me know the ways. \\n\\nAll things considered, I definitely belive that a group tour led by a tour guide is not interesting or exciting at all. By going new place alone, we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the people there. \\n\""
